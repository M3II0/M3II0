 Hello, my name is M3II0 and welcome to my profile. I don't know how you got here, but I'll be happy if you read the entire README.md to the end.
 In my free time, I do programming, mainly in C#, C and Java. I already have quite a lot of functional codes and I have been on quite a few minecraft projects in Czechoslovakia. I will list SurvivalGames, Qplay, BasicLand and Glowsite for example, but there are more.
